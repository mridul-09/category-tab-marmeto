Problem Statement: Develop a web page to showcase content obtained from an API, sorting it into three sections: Men, Women, and Kids.

Approach:

1. Fetch data from the API and save it in an array.
2. Classify the data into separate arrays according to categories for a structured presentation.
3. Present default results categorized as Men upon the initial API data retrieval.
4. Implement dynamic HTML content updates when users click on category buttons, seamlessly reflecting the selected category.
